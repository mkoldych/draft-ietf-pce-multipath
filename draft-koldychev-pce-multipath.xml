    <abstract>


<t>Current PCEP standards allow only one intended and/or actual path to be present
in a PCEP report or update. Applications that require multipath support such as
SR Policy require an extension to allow signaling multiple intended and/or
actual paths within a single PCEP message. This document introduces such an
extension. Encoding of multiple intended and/or actual paths is done by
encoding multiple Explicit Route Objects (EROs) and/or multiple Record Route
Objects (RROs). A special separator object is defined in this document, to
facilitate this. This mechanism is applicable to SR-TE and RSVP-TE and is
dataplane agnostic.</t>

<t>Path Computation Element (PCE) Communication Protocol (PCEP)
<xref target="RFC5440"/> enables the communication between a Path Computation Client
(PCC) and a Path Control Element (PCE), or between two PCEs based on
the PCE architecture <xref target="RFC4655"/>.</t>

<t>PCEP Extensions for the Stateful PCE Model <xref target="RFC8231"/> describes a set
of extensions to PCEP that enable active control of Multiprotocol Label
Switching Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS)
tunnels.  <xref target="RFC8281"/> describes the setup and teardown of PCE-initiated
LSPs under the active stateful PCE model, without the need for local
configuration on the PCC, thus allowing for dynamic centralized
control of a network.</t>

<t>PCEP Extensions for Segment Routing <xref target="RFC8664"/>
specifies extensions to the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP)
that allow a stateful PCE to compute and initiate Traffic Engineering
(TE) paths, as well as for a PCC to request a path subject to certain
constraint(s) and optimization criteria in SR networks.</t>

<t>Segment Routing Policy for Traffic Engineering
<xref target="I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy"/> details the concepts of SR
Policy and approaches to steering traffic into an SR Policy.  In
particular, it describes the SR candidate-path as a collection of one
or more Segment-Lists.  The current PCEP standards only allow for
signaling of one Segment-List per Candidate-Path.  PCEP extension to
support Segment Routing Policy Candidate Paths
<xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing-policy-cp"/> specifically avoids
defining how to signal multipath information, and states that this
will be defined in another document.</t>

<t>This document defines the required extensions that allow the signaling
of multipath information via PCEP.</t>

<section anchor="motivation" title="Motivation">

<t>This extension is motivated by the use-cases described below.</t>

<section anchor="signaling-multiple-segment-lists-of-an-sr-candidate-path" title="Signaling Multiple Segment-Lists of an SR Candidate-Path">

<t>The Candidate-Path of an SR Policy is the unit of report/update in PCEP, see
<xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing-policy-cp"/>.  Each Candidate-Path can
contain multiple Segment-Lists and each Segment-List is encoded by
one ERO.  However, each PCEP LSP can contain only a
single ERO (containing multiple SR-ERO subobject), which prevents us from encoding multiple Segment-
Lists within the same SR Candidate-Path.</t>

<t>With the help of the protocol extensions defined in this document,
this limitation is overcome.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="splitting-of-requested-bandwidth" title="Splitting of Requested Bandwidth">

<t>A PCC may request a path with 80 Gbps of bandwidth, but all links in the
network have only 50 Gbps capacity.  The PCE can return two paths, that can
together carry 80 Gbps. The PCC can then equally or unequally split the incoming
80 Gbps of traffic among the two paths. <xref target="WEIGHT-TLV"/> introduces a
new TLV that carries the path weight that allows for distribution of incoming
traffic on to the multiple paths.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="providing-backup-path-for-protection" title="Providing Backup path for Protection">

<t>It is desirable for the PCE to compute and signal to the PCC a backup path
that is used to protect a primary path within the multipaths in a given LSP.</t>

<t>Note that <xref target="RFC8745"/> specify the Path Protection association among LSPs. The use of <xref target="RFC8745"/> with multipath is out of scope of this document and is for future study.</t>

<t>When multipath is used, a backup path may protect one or more primary
paths.  For this reason, primary and backup path identifiers are needed to
indicate which backup path(s) protect which primary path(s).
<xref target="BACKUP-TLV"/> introduces a new TLV that carries the required information.</t>

<section anchor="OP" title="Operation">

<t>When the PCC wants to indicate to the PCE that it wants to get
multipaths for a PCEP Tunnel, instead of a single path, it can do (1) or both (1) and (2) of the
following:</t>

<t>(1) Send the MULTIPATH-CAP TLV in the OPEN object during session
       establishment.  This applies to all PCEP Tunnels on the PCC,
       unless overridden by PCEP Tunnel specific information.</t>

<t>(2) Additionally send the MULTIPATH-CAP TLV in the LSP object for a particular
       PCEP Tunnel in the PCRpt or PCReq message.  This applies to the specified
       PCEP Tunnel and overrides the information from the OPEN object.</t>

<t>When PCE computes the path for a PCEP Tunnel, it MUST NOT return more
multipaths than the corresponding value of “Number of Multipaths”
from the MULTIPATH-CAP TLV.  If this TLV is absent (from both OPEN
and LSP objects), then the “Number of Multipaths” is assumed to be 1.</t>

<t>If the PCE supports this standard, then it MUST include the
MULTIPATH-CAP TLV in the OPEN object.  This tells the PCC that it can
report multiple ERO/RRO objects per PCEP Tunnel to this PCE.  If the PCE does not include
the MULTIPATH-CAP TLV in the OPEN object, then the PCC MUST assume
that the PCE does not support this standard and fall back to
reporting only a single ERO/RRO. The PCE MUST NOT include MULTIPATH-CAP TLV
in the LSP object in any other PCEP message towards the PCC and the PCC MUST ignore it if received.</t>

<t>The Path ID of each ERO/RRO MUST be unique within that LSP.
If a PCEP speaker detects that there are two paths with the same Path ID,
then the PCEP speaker SHOULD send PCError message with
Error-Type = 1 (“Reception of an invalid object”) and
Error-Value = TBD4 (“Conflicting Path ID”).</t>

<section anchor="signaling-multiple-paths-for-loadbalancing" title="Signaling Multiple Paths for Loadbalancing">

<t>The PATH-ATTRIB object can be used to signal multiple path(s) and indicate
(un)equal loadbalancing amongst the set of multipaths. In this case, the
PATH-ATTRIB is populated for each ERO or SERO as follows:</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>The PCE assigns a unique Path ID to each ERO or SERO path and populates
it inside the PATH-ATTRIB object. The Path ID is unique within the
context of a PLSP or PCEP Tunnel.</t>
  <t>The MULTIPATH-WEIGHT TLV MAY be carried inside the PATH-ATTRIB object. A
weight is populated to reflect the relative loadshare that is to be
carried by the path. If the MULTIPATH-WEIGHT is not carried inside a
PATH-ATTRIB object, the default weight 1 MUST be assumed when computing
the loadshare.</t>

are updated according to the number of backup path ID(s) included.</t>
  <t>The MULTIPATH-BACKUP TLV MAY be added inside the PATH-ATTRIB object for each

any backup path IDs in the TLV. If the path acts as a pure backup – i.e.
the path only carries rerouted traffic after the protected path(s) fail– then
the B flag MUST be set.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Note that if a given path has the B-flag set, then there MUST be some other path
within the same LSP that uses the given path as a backup.
If this condition is violated, then the PCEP speaker SHOULD send a PCError message
with Error-Type = 10 (“Reception of an invalid object”) and
Error-Value = TBD5 (“No primary path for pure backup”).</t>

<t>Note that a given PCC may not support certain backup combinations,
such as a backup path that is itself protected by another backup path, etc.

<abstract><t>Segment Routing (SR) enables any head-end node to select any path without relying on a hop-by-hop signaling technique (e.g., LDP or RSVP-TE). It depends only on &quot;segments&quot; that are advertised by link-state Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs). An SR path can be derived from a variety of mechanisms, including an IGP Shortest Path Tree (SPT), an explicit configuration, or a Path Computation Element (PCE). This document specifies extensions to the Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) that allow a stateful PCE to compute and initiate Traffic-Engineering (TE) paths, as well as a Path Computation Client (PCC) to request a path subject to certain constraints and optimization criteria in SR networks.</t><t>This document updates RFC 8408.</t></abstract>
